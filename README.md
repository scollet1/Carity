# Carity

## A collaboration between 42 and ESD students

Carity was a project idea formed by myself, another developer from 42, Silicon Valley, [Ian Wagner](https://github.com/dawag415) and two design students from L'École Supérieure du Digital (ESD), [Tracy Girault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-girault-23578b94/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3BWq58guDcQpOauQnSt7fyDQ%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections-profile) and [Andrea Peytier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-peytier-44497b96/)

The project was overseen by Nissan-Renault and revolved around the automotive industry.

Over the course of a week, we were tasked with brainstorming a product to be used by car owners. It could be anything. IoT and connectivity, autonomous driving, shipping, rideshare, etc. We decided to make a charity app. And so we came up with **Carity**

Carity is simple. You choose a charity. You drive. The charity recieves money equal to the amount of miles driven. Of course there are other methods of transportation, but we are focusing on automotive transport as the backbone for donation generation.

The framework we used was React-Native, which we had never used before that weekend. In fact, 72 hours before the deadline, neither of us knew React-Native was even a thing. React-Native was pleasantly surprising as I had only worked with the vanilla web-stack (JS, HTML, CSS) before this. Being able to load up the app in an online [simulator](https://expo.io/) was a great feeling. I would like to work with this technology some more, mostly because it yields rapid development cycles and fast prototyping. The effectiveness of our workflow was the best I've ever seen, and that was with a double language barrier! 

Personally, I find it hard to design on the fly, especially with a background in backend engineering. With a designer and a project manager, everything was smooth as butter. The only hiccups came from not understanding the technology at first, but were qucikly ironed out as the designs were physically implemented in the app.

We have yet to deploy.
